# PhantomJS
Phantom.js is a web API to simplify the webgame development proccess.
Phantom.js supports both 2D and 3D games with readable and simple scripting!

# Warning
Hi guys. For those using `Server`, it has been removed until further notice due to dependency issues.\
I hope to issue a fix within the coming week.

# Download
