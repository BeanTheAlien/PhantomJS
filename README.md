# PhantomJS
Phantom.js is a web API to simplify the webgame development proccess.\
Phantom.js supports both 2D and 3D games with readable and simple scripting!\
Phantom.js is a side project, most of my focus is directed to [GhostScript](https://github.com/BeanTheAlien/GhostScript), so sorry for lack of attention on this. <3

# Download
Avalible with `npm`!
```
npm install @beanthealien/phantomjs
